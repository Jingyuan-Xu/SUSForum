## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Motivation and Background

### 1.3 Project Scope

*(This section specifies which contents are within the scope of the system, thus further describing and clarifying

### 2.2 Project Schedule

*(Your team should confirm every member's role; project manager, business manager and technical architect are

(sample...)

## 3. Suggested Deliverables

*(In this section, You should suggest deliverables to be submitted for milestone 2 and milestone 3 (final delivery)
by your schedule. Typical deliverable might include working code, documentation, training materials, test suites,
etc. You should also briefly describe the suggested deliverable.)*

### 3.1 Milestone 2 Deliverable

*(if the suggested deliverable for milestone 2 is a software system with 50% the basic functionalities, you should
describe what these basic functionalities are.)*

### 3.2 Milestone 3 Deliverable

*(You should have finished project development. Listing all documents you've finished and all deliverables that
you'll deliver to the clients.)*
